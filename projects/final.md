## Overview

Finding a compatible roommate in Honolulu can be a frustrating experience for UH Mānoa students. Many turn to Facebook groups, Craigslist, or word of mouth, which often results in mismatched expectations, safety concerns, or scams. Students who are new to the island or moving between leases face added stress trying to secure affordable housing and trustworthy roommates.
<strong>RoomMatch UHM</strong> aims to provide a safer and more efficient way for UH Mānoa students to find housing and compatible roommates. The platform connects students based on verified UH accounts, lifestyle compatibility, and shared housing preferences. By using matching algorithms and built-in verification, RoomMatch UHM reduces uncertainty and helps students form reliable living arrangements in a safe, student-centered environment.

## Approach 

To use RoomMatch UHM, a student first logs in with their UH email to verify their identity and create a personal profile. The profile captures key preferences such as budget, desired location, lease dates, daily routine, cleanliness, and noise tolerance. The student’s top five preferences are displayed up front, and other interests can be viewed by clicking into the full profile. Students can also indicate whether they are “seeking a room” or “offering a room.” The system’s “special sauce” is a compatibility algorithm that compares these preferences with those of other users and generates a compatible list. Potential roommates are then displayed in order of compatibility, making it easy for students to find the best fit quickly.
Each user has access to a dashboard displaying potential matches, direct messaging, and an option to schedule meetings in safe, public campus locations such as Hamilton Library or Campus Center. A built-in calendar feature enables users to plan meetups or manage move-in timelines. To ensure accountability, users can leave post-match feedback and rate their experience in categories such as reliability, cleanliness, and communication.
Administrators monitor the platform to ensure postings are authentic and community guidelines are upheld. Any user who suspects inappropriate behavior or fraud can report it for review. The system prioritizes both trust and transparency, making roommate matching a safer, community-supported experience for UH Mānoa students.
