If you would have told me when I was 12 that I would grow up to be so proud to be just like my grandmother, I would've had doubts. She was hard on us as kids and I never took the time to understand her while she was around. Now however, it is abundantly clear I take after her more and more as time goes on.

Most recently, I've taken up her life-time hobby of sewing. She was a master at it, and now as I sit in front of my sewing machine I'm convinced her energy is in the universe helping me out. Picking up sewing without any training or instruction has made me a more detail oriented person. Now when I am at a clothing store, instead of buying the items I like, I take a moment and carefully examine how they were made, with what kind of fabric, and how I could make it better. After recieving my sewing machine for the holidays last year, I sat in front of it for what seemed like the whole rest of winter break. And when I came home again for summer break I was back to spending at least 2 hours a night working on pieces. 

At first I only had the passion, and I was sure none of the talent to actually make something worth wearing. However, after ruining plenty of fabric, and being disappointed time and time again, I finally started to impress myself with the pieces I was able to make. 

After being comfortable with my skill level, I made myself a tailored dress and a pair of linen pants, I made friends birthday gifts like bookmarks and pouches, and I made my brother's baby a cute little outfit with a matching toy. Over the course of the past 9 months I have learned countless important lessons about making things. Not only technical lessons, but mental lessons as well. Every day that I sit in front of my sewing machine teaches me patience, lets me let go of perfectionism, and makes me value the process.
