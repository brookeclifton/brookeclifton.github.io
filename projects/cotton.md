I am the youngest of four, with siblings ranging in ages 24 through 33 years old. Each year when a holiday came around, I knew that the best I could do would be to craft something for my siblings and parents. As I've gotten older, I've come to the realization that my family has no use for a hand drawn picture, even if they act like they love it.

So, when I found out that my oldest brother Trent and his wife were expecting a baby boy, I was at a loss. What could I possibly give to my successful brother who could buy any baby gadget or outfit in the world? 


Cotton is a horror-style text-based adventure game I developed using the functions and macros built from The Wizard's Game in [Conrad Barski's Land of Lisp](http://landoflisp.com/). Slightly more interesting and convoluted! (It is not that scary.)

To give you a flavor of the game, here is an excerpt from one run:

<hr>

<pre>
You open your eyes, and you are greeted by an unfamiliar ceiling.
Startled, you get to your feet and quickly scan your surroundings. It's
dark except for the stream of light coming from a crack on the only boarded
window in the room. You try to peek through the crack, but you cannot see
anything. You wonder where you are and who could have possibly brought you here.

<------------------------------------------------>

look
The room is a picture of decay with only a faded number identifying it as room-4. The bed you were
 lying on is stained with what looks like dried blood. Could it be your blood? No - it is not. The
 only way out of the room aside from the door to the corridor is a window that is boarded shut. It
 looks like it has been like that for decades. There is a door going west from here. You see a candle
 on the floor. You see a match on the floor.

pickup candle

The candle is now lit. It illuminates everything in the room.

walk west
The corridor is lit with the candle. It is so long that you cannot see to the end. You notice that
 there are words written on the wall. There is a door going east from here. There is a way going north
 from here. There is a door going south from here.
