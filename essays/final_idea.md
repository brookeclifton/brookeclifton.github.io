## Overview

Many UH Mānoa students and faculty love animals but cannot own pets due to housing restrictions or demanding schedules. At the same time, pet owners in the campus area often need trustworthy individuals to help with walking, sitting, or short-term care. Currently, pet owners rely on informal arrangements or external apps that do not verify users, leading to safety concerns and unreliable service.
<strong>PawPal UHM</strong> is designed to connect local pet owners with verified UH students and faculty who want to offer pet care or walking services. The app creates a trustworthy, campus-centered network that benefits both groups while ensuring safety and animal well-being. By using UH verification, structured booking, and post-session reports, PawPal builds a culture of responsible care and genuine connection.

## Approach
To join PawPal UHM, users log in using their UH email and select their role as “Pet Owner,” “Walker/Sitter,” or both. Owners can create detailed profiles for their pets, including breed, size, temperament, health conditions, and walking preferences. Walkers and sitters create their own profiles listing availability, experience, comfort level with various species, and hourly or volunteer rates.
The “special sauce” of PawPal UHM lies in its personalized match feed, which prioritizes walkers and owners based on proximity, experience, and compatibility with the pet’s needs. For instance, if an owner’s dog is shy around other animals, the algorithm highlights walkers who have indicated experience with anxious or reactive pets.
All first meetings are required to occur in public, daylight locations such as the Campus Center lawn or Mānoa Stream path. Once a booking is confirmed, the owner and walker can communicate through in-app messaging, share notes, and complete a short “care checklist” to ensure both parties understand expectations. After each session, the walker submits a brief care report, and the owner provides feedback and a rating.

## Mockup page ideas

Mockup ideas for PawPal UHM include:
<ul>Landing Page explaining how PawPal works and outlining safety measures</ul>
<ul>User Home Page tailored for Owners or Walkers</ul>
<ul>Create/Edit Profile Page (pet profiles or service experience)</ul>

<ul>Rating and Feedback Page</ul>

## Use case ideas

A pet owner logs into PawPal, creates a profile for their dog, and requests a 30-minute evening walk near campus. The system recommends nearby walkers experienced with that breed and temperament. The owner selects a walker, confirms the booking, and meets in person at a safe location. After the walk, the walker logs the route and submits a care report, while the owner provides feedback and a star rating.
Similarly, a new walker joins PawPal, lists availability, and receives automatic notifications when an owner nearby needs urgent help. The walker can accept the request, complete the session, and earn points or reviews that boost their credibility.

## Beyond the basics

Advanced features could include digital badges for specialized skills such as pet first-aid or reactive-dog handling, GPS-tracked walks, smart recommendations for recurring care, and integration with local veterinary clinics for emergency resources. PawPal could also host “Campus Pet Therapy Days,” where verified walkers bring animals to campus for stress-relief sessions during finals week.
By connecting responsible pet owners and caring students through a verified, campus-focused system, PawPal UHM supports well-being for both people and animals while nurturing community trust and companionship at UH Mānoa.
