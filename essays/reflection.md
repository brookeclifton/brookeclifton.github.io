Throughout this course, I've come to understand that software engineering is much broader than simply building a website. The web stack we used, involving React, Next.js, Bootstrap, GitHub, and VS Code, served as a vehicle for learning foundational princples that can apply to any project. 

## Configuration Management

For example <i>configuration management</i>, which refers to the tools and processes used to trakc and control changes to software, became much more intuitive for me as I spent time navigating GitHub. Before this class, I was framiliar with branching, committing, and merging, but repeated use showed me how essential these tools are for collaboration. I can now see how configuration management would be critical in any sort of web development.

## Development Environments

Similarly, I grew significantly more comfortable within <i>development environments</i>, which include the editors, debuggers, compilers, and support tools that make coding possible. VS Code went from being a simple code editor to a customizable workspace, as I learned to use extensions, linters, and manage Git from inside it. Understanding how to configure and navigate a development environment is a transferable skill in that no matter what I am coding, or what language, I now know how to adapt the tooling that each environment requires. Learning to operate comfortably within these systems gave me a much stronger sense of confidence and autonomy as a developer. 

## User Interface Frameworks

The topic that stood out to me most was <i>user interface frameworks</i>. These frameworks, such as React or Bootstrap, provide pre-built components and patterns that make it possible to design visually appealing, interactive interfaces without needing to understand every detail of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Discovering UI Frameworks has honestly been one of my favorite parts of being a Computer Science major because it opened the door to visual creativity in my work. As someone who could spend hours playing around with websites on Figma just for fun, this was the perfect canvas to exercise my ability. It allowed me to experiment with layout, styling, and intuitive design in a much less time-consuming way. This not only made web development more enjoyable but also helped me understand that UI frameworks are used well beyond websites, they appear in mobile apps, desktop applications, VR interfaces, etc. The core idea is the same throughout, generalizing the low-level complexity of an application so developers can focus on user experience and functionality.

## Takeaways

While the class covered many additional concepts, such as <i>agile project management, functional programming, design patterns, </i>and <i>ethics in software engineering</i>, each contributed to my broader understanding of what it means to build software collaboratively. These topics showed me that software engineering is not defined at all, not by a language or type of project. Instead, it is more of a mindset to create clarity, maintainability, collaboration, and functionality in the digital world. This course helped me build that mindset, and I can already see how the skills I practiced will support every future project I take on.
