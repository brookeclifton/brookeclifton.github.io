## Learning TypeScript

Learning a new coding language always comes with trials and tribulations. I have spent multiple semesters trying to wrap my head around Java, and I still struggle even now. However, this was a completely different story with typescript. While this may make the language less useful in a software engineering sense, I appreciate the simplicity of the language. I found that typescript and javascript are extremely logical languages. Often times an educated guess is all you need when coding in typescript.  

## An Unathletic Programmer

The simplicity of the language is also why the Workouts Of the Day assessments are relatively painless. You are able to spend much less time trying to find just the right function, and less time organizing your code for a picky compiler. Before I attempted any of the WOD’s, I was intimidated by the notion of being graded based on my time. However, because coding in typescript is so straightforward, my fears have subsided. In future workplaces I do feel like it will be beneficial to have a background in finding simple solutions quickly, as it will make out lives as the programmers much easier. 


## My Inspiration

I used to wonder how my mom balanced being a successful programmer with having four children and a house to take care of. Now that I am experienced in the realm of Computer Science, I see that her success comes from her being able to achieve things in two hours when it would take someone less experienced all day. This allowed her to be able to do a whole day’s worth of work in the few short moments she had available, and gave her the work life balance that she needed. My long term goal as a programmer is to have even a fraction of her speed and intelligence, and I hope that training myself to improve my WOD time will help me work towards that goal.
