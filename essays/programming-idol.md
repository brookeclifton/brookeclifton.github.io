## Learning TypeScript

Learning a new coding language always comes with trials and tribulations. I have spent multiple semesters trying to wrap my head around Java, and I still occasionally struggle with it to this day. However, the experience I have had with TypeScript has been much different. While other languages can almost read like encrypted text to an untrained eye, TypeScript allows programmers to use more natural sounding language. Often, an educated guess is all you need if you don't know a certain declaration syntax.

## An Unathletic Programmer

In this course, <i>Intro to Software Engineering</i>, we are asked to design websites under a time limit. These 'workouts' may have seemed daunting in the past, but the simplicity of TypeScript makes them painless. Much less time is spent trying to find just the right function, or organizing your code for a picky complier. Before I attempted any of these 'workouts', I was intimidated by the notion of being graded based on my efficiency. However, because coding in TypeScript is so straightforward, my fears have dimminished. Instead, I have realized that the daily exersices are sharpening my ability to quickly deconstruct, code, and stay focused under pressure.


## My Inspiration

My mom has been a software engineer for fourty years. Since I've began pursuing Computer Science, it has never failed to amaze me how quick she would finish her day's work. How was she able to balance 4 kids, a house to take care of, and a demanding job? Now I can see that her success comes from her being able to achieve tasks in a couple hours when it would take someone less experienced a whole day. This allowed her to be able to do a whole day's work in the few short hours she had available, and gave her the work-life balance that she required. I can only hope that I have even a fraction of her speed and intelligence one day, and I hope that training myself to improve my 'workout' speed will help me towards that goal.
