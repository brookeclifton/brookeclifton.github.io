## Introduction

When I chose to be a Computer Science major three years ago, the job market seemed relatively safe. Since then, with the exponential growth of AI, doubts about job security have been on the rise. It is hard to imagine that AI will <i>not</i> advance enough in the next year that businesses will be able to replace their programmers with a monthly subscription to the latest ChatGPT. With this in mind, I try to avoid giving AI the education that I am paying for. I once saw a perspective that pasting your assignments into AI is like training them to have your exact degree, which really put it into perspective for me.
However, it is impossible to ignore the practicallity of using AI in certain software engineering assignments. Tools like ChatGPT can be an incredible resource for the typical busy work that takes up so much coding time. Additionally, Github Copilot for example functions in a way where the AI is already reading and improving your code as you work, so it is hard to justify not taking its answer. 

## Personal Experience
#### Experience WODs
In experience WODs, I used AI to guide me, since instructions could be slightly harder to follow than in regular WODs. Often times, I would follow the instructions given, and come across an error that the material did not mention. This is when I would turn to ChatGPT to get to the bottom of why the step did not work.
#### In-class WODs
The most useful time to apply AI usage was during in-class WODs. In a timed environment, it makes sense to let your resources guide you and help with the little things. In almost every WOD, I used AI as a more advanced, detailed Google. Instead of searching through a W3Schools page, which would be my usual go to if not for the time restriction, I can quickly see all the necessary information with examples.
#### Essays
I value the exercise of writing, especially when it comes to topics that you are just getting framiliar with. I feel like writing an essay encourages you to research more about the topic, so you learn as you write. I tried not to use any AI for writing essays in this class, since I feel that when writing, it is better to sound genuine than to sound perfect. However, if I ever had confusion about the topic of the essay, I would ask AI for a brief overview of the topic so I knew exactly what to focus on.
#### Final Project
While I feel that AI is a useful resource, and in my experience fairly accurate, I understand that other people may not want to utilize it. Since the final project is a group project, I try to minimize my use of AI to ensure that nobody is uncomfortable with my work.
#### Learning concepts / Tutorials
The same thing goes for tutorials as experience WODs. Tutorials often led me to a dead end in some way, since they were not always completely up to date. ChatGPT helped me on many tutorials to get past roadblocks in these tutorials.
#### Answering questions in class/Discord/smart-questions channel
I do not believe that answering a question in class or on the Discord using AI has any benefit. When a student is asking a question, it can be assumed that they have already tried Google and AI. Most of the time, they are looking for a more personalized answer. When a professor is asking a question, they want to get a gauge of what students know, so if one has to put it into AI to get the answer, they shouldn't be answering the question.
#### Coding Example
The most beneficial aspect of an AI query is that it immediately comes up with a concise explanation, with examples. Although I don't ususally specifically request examples, they tend to be the most useful part of using AI for coding exercises. While these examples are available anywhere else on the web, it is much more efficient to get a relevant example without having to search for it.
#### Explaining code
Many of our exercises involve coming back to a program once a week to change/improve it. This at times could lead to some confusion about my intentions in my last coding session. Rarely, I will paste some of my code into AI, asking something like "which line is making the navbar disappear as I scroll?", so that I can easily locate where I want to make a change.
#### Writing code
The most prominent example of using AI to write code comes from the Copilot available in VSCode. Frequently, even when it is not my intention to reference AI, it guesses the rest of my line. Especially in a timed setting, it is hard to avoid simply clicking the tab button and letting it read my mind. On occasions where I am truly stuck during the coding process, I might use AI to give me a general idea of how it thinks it should be done. Most of the time, there is some small thing that I hadn't thought about that makes all the difference.
#### Documenting code
Since most of my programs are for my eyes only, I don't document my code thoroughly enough that I would think to require AI to do it for me. My documentation is usually pretty simple, mostly for my own understanding.
#### Quality assurance
Quality assurance is by far my most used application of AI. Especially when working in groups or for a grade, I find that pasting what I've written into ChatGPT and asking "Anything I should be worried about?" leads to some discoveries that may have been detrimental. While compliers can check for literal errors, in Typescript there are fewer literal errors. It is more likely that something is less than ideal, and will perhaps cause an issue down the line.

## Impact on Learning and Understanding
While the increase of AI's abilities has changed how I learn, I see it as a positive change. Before I had a resource that could give me quick and thourough answers, the process of coding could be extremely frustrating. Searching for errors, examples, and explanations, coming to an unexplained dead end in a tutorial, and trying to find explanations for small problems were all frequent issues I had. Before, I felt like I was getting so little done in so much time, which made me feel uncapable and unintelligent. Being able to breeze through small challenges hidden in lines and lines of code has made me a more confident programmer. I feel like I have support throughout the learning process when my traditional resources aren't enough. 

## Practical Applications
Outside of college, I've seen AI used in ways that feel much closer to real software engineering work. AI can act as an on-demand teammate during project-based event like the HACC. It can generate data, help mockup UI ideas, or explain APIs quickly so teams can keep their momentum. In these settings, AI wasn't doing the project, but removing friction so programmers can focus on the real engineering decisions.  

## Challenges and Oppurtunities 
Knowing that AI could potentially replace my future job has given me an oppurtunity to find interest in beyond the basics of software engineering. In order to compete with AI, there must be some human component of our work. For me, having this pressure encouraged me to take my education down a more creative track. Switching my focus to Creative Computational Media is how I feel that I am slowing down the race against AI. Ideally, I would love to go into a field where my human creativity is translated into the digital world. I don't know if I ever would have explored this path if not for the worries of AI being better than me at my future job. 

## Comparative Analysis
Traditional teaching methods encourage a slower, deeper engagement with material, which I consider valuable. Reading documentation, searching for examples, and experimenting manually all build long-term skills. However, in an age where the resources are available to programmers that will let them skip these steps, it is important that we all learn how to best use these tools. This will create an environment in the software engineering world where talented people can go beyond what has ever been done before. AI-enhanced learning makes the overall process feel smoother. This often improves engagement because you are not constantly fighting frustration, and it helps with practical skill development by letting you focus on the big picture. While both have their benefits, it is important to cater curriculum to the ever-changing environment.

## Future Considerations
I think AI will continue to play a bigger role in software engineering education, but ideally in a way that supports rather than replaces it. AI could become part of personalized learning systems, providing automated feedback on assignments, or even help simulate realistic project environments. At the same time, there will always be challenges, like preventing over-reliance and ensuring students still learn the critical thinking skills required. I hope future courses find a balance where AI is treated not as a shortcut but as a companion.

## Conclusion
Overall, using AI through the semester has changed how I view both learning and software engineering as a subject. It has made the process feel more accessible and less intimidating, and it has helped me move through roadbloacks that previously may have derailed my progress. At the same time, it has pushed me to think about my own role in a field that is changing quickly, and what unique human skills I want to bring to my work.
