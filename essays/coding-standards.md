## Anticipation

When I first saw the “Coding Standards” module, I visualized rules to make our lives harder. Yet, after a week of learning ESLint in VSCode, I’ve begun to appreciate their deeper purpose and the practical benefits they bring, especially when paired with modern development tools. 

## It Could Be Worse!

Considering my most recent ICS class relied heavily on VI in the terminal, errors were cryptic and often difficult to parse. A missing semicolon or misplaced bracket could cause 15 minutes of useless problem solving. Debugging in that environment required careful attention to detail, which, while educational, became mentally exhausting and time-consuming. By contrast, using VSCode with ESLint creates an environment where errors are highlighted in real time, and the rules themselves are transparent and immediately fixable. This makes coding a more proactive process for me, where the editor is your friend instead of your enemy.


## Finding Usefulness

At first, attempting to eliminate all ESLint errors may feel overwhelming because there tend to be many. However, I have noticed that they are all small adjustments, and they actually help me to code more efficiently. I can focus on the larger logic of the program, knowing that the tools will enforce the small rules. I am no longer wasting time on running the code and having it fail, but instead I can see every place where it may fail along the way, and I have an opportunity to fix it.

In conclusion, ESLint and VSCode demonstrate how coding standards, when combined with modern tools, can transform the coding experience. What should feel like nitpicking is in reality a guided helper tool that helps me to improve my efficiency and clarity. They allow me to code smarter, not harder.
