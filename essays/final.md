## Overview

Finding a compatible roommate in Honolulu can be a frustrating experience for UH Mānoa students. Many turn to Facebook groups, Craigslist, or word of mouth, which often results in mismatched expectations, safety concerns, or scams. Students who are new to the island or moving between leases face added stress trying to secure affordable housing and trustworthy roommates.
RoomMatch UHM aims to provide a safer and more efficient way for UH Mānoa students to find housing and compatible roommates. The platform connects students based on verified UH accounts, lifestyle compatibility, and shared housing preferences. By using matching algorithms and built-in verification, RoomMatch UHM reduces uncertainty and helps students form reliable living arrangements in a safe, student-centered environment.

## Names of the proposers

## Mockup page ideas

Some envisioned mockup pages for this project include:
<ul>Landing Page introducing the platform and its benefits</ul>
<ul>User Profile Page with compatibility survey and preferences weighting</ul>
<ul>Browse Listings Page for filtering available rooms or roommate seekers</ul>
<ul>Match Detail Page showing compatibility breakdowns</ul>
<ul>Messaging and Scheduling Page</ul>
<ul>Ratings and Feedback Dashboard</ul>
<ul>Admin Dashboard for moderation and verification</ul>


## Use case ideas

A new user logs in with their UH email, completes their profile and survey, and instantly receives a list of potential roommates ranked by compatibility. The student can browse listings, message a potential match, and schedule a meeting in a safe public space. After the move-in period, both roommates can leave mutual feedback to help maintain a transparent and trustworthy system. Administrators can review and verify listings, manage reports, and ensure compliance with the platform’s community standards.

## Beyond the basics

After implementing the basic functionality, RoomMatch UHM could expand to include advanced features such as a map-based search tool displaying walking and bus commute times to campus, a “split rent” cost calculator, and an optional “roommate agreement” template for establishing shared responsibilities. Additional upgrades could include smart reminders for lease renewals, fraud detection tools, and conflict mediation resources for roommates.
RoomMatch UHM addresses a persistent problem in the student community—safe and compatible housing—while fostering a sense of trust, transparency, and campus connection.
