## Projecting Time Estimations

To make my initial effort estimates, I relied primarily on self assessment and prior experience with similar assignments. Historically, I tend to work more slowly than many of my peers, so my estimates were intentionally conservative. I generally assumed tasks would take longer than expected to accommodate reading through my teammate's code and trying to match their styles in mine. Since I typically completed each task in a single sitting, my estimates were calculated by checking the time before and after I made my commits. 

Even though my estimates were often off, estimating in advance still provided meaningful benefits. For example, thinking through the expected effort forced me to anticipate complexity ahead of time and mentally budget time in my schedule. It also helped me recognize when something took significantly longer than projected, which highlighted tasks I might need more practice with. Even incorrect estimates gave structure to my workflow and prevented me from procrastinating.

## Tracking Actual Effort

Tracking my actual effort was useful as well. Knowing I had to compare real time against estimated time made me more accountable to contribute fairly alongside my teammates. It also revealed patterns in my work habits—for instance, I often finished a task and then remembered small follow-up changes, which added extra 10 minute increments that I hadn’t planned for. These insights helped me understand why my estimates skewed short and how unanticipated adjustments accumulate in real projects.

I tracked actual effort by simply noting the time before I started and the time after I finished each sitting. Because I completed tasks in long, uninterrupted work sessions, this method was straightforward but not perfectly precise. Small context switches, mental breaks, and follow-up fixes made the total slightly inaccurate.

## Future Effort Tracking

Looking ahead, I would change both my estimation and tracking process. I would break tasks into smaller components so estimates could be more realistic and easier to measure. I would also track effort using a timer in the future, to avoid forgetting small additions or revisions. Most importantly, I would try to treat estimation as a learning tool rather than something to be embarrassed about. The goal is improvement, not perfection.
