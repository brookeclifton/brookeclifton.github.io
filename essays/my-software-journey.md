## Finding a Place for my Talents

My interest in software engineering comes from a desire to see how technology can blend creativity with functionality. While I am still in early stages of exploring the concept, I have been drawn to designing websites using languages like HTML and CSS. For example, currently I have an ongoing project designing a digital cookbook. This project was what made me realize that perhaps my artistic side could give me an advantage in this field where I have usually found myself feeling inferior. In the past, I have completed course projects without ever really understanding the point. This project was what showed me that I can build things that are incredibly functional to me in my personal life. 

## Expanding Beyond What I Know

In the future, I hope to expand my skills beyond front-end design with a newfound passion in the subject. I want to learn many more programming languages, web frameworks, and back-end development to understand how complex systems work behind the scenes. However, I never want to stop implementing my creativity using software engineering. 

## Communication and Collaboration

While many of my peers can be extremely soft spoken in group settings, I’ve found that one of my strengths is creating open, comfortable dialogue that increases the productivity of group work, and translating technical concepts so that collaborators from other disciplines can easily engage. In a field where it’s common for people to hold back ideas until they feel ‘perfect,’ I’ve learned that real progress happens when we create space for early, imperfect thoughts. Open communication leads to better collaboration and better outcomes. I envision that I will be able to lead teams by balancing my technical skill with my interpersonal skills in an effort to merge technology, innovation, and human focused design. This is a skill that I hope to develop during the remainder of my education and bring to future jobs.


Ultimately, I hope that my journey in software engineering will help me build systems that are both technologically advanced and aesthetically pleasing. I see it as a field where I can continue to grow as I learn more, creating work that is meaningful and fulfilling.
